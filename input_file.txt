Registering for Spring Term
I understand you would like to register for the Spring term.
Unfortunately, you don't have enough money.

Peace,

Seling your iPhone
I am responding to your ad for an iPhone 6.  
I am willing to spend $30 for it, no more. Let me know 
what you think.

Cheers,

Hi Josh,

I was really impressed with your coding skills, and I've decided
that you would handle the company much better than I would.  As such,
I am offering you the position of CEO at Facebook, should you choose
to accept it.

All the best,
Mark

Reminder
Hi Josh,

I am just writing to remind you of the importance of education. Teaching
is one of the noblest professions, and one day you should help others learn
what you have learned yourself.

Have a great day

Your theory on generative grammar is excellent, better than my own I think.
You should be the new professor of linguistics at MIT.  I will write you a
letter of recommendation.

All the best,
The Noamster
